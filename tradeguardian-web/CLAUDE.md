You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

    ### Objective
    - Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

    ### Code Style and Structure
    - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
    - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
    - Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
    - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
    - Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

    ### Rendering: client-side only
    - Pages are never built on the server with data. Don't fetch data, read cookies or headers, or compute per-user content in Server Components, `generateMetadata`, or server actions.
    - A page with data or per-user content has a thin Server Component `page.tsx` that only exports static `metadata` and renders a `'use client'` component; that component does all data fetching and interaction in the browser. Pages with only static content (home, FAQ) have no data and are prerendered at build time.
    - Fetch data in the browser with TanStack Query (backend) and wagmi hooks (chain reads, batched into one multicall). The browser calls tradeguardian-backend directly at `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`.
    - Show loading placeholders while data loads in the client component, not via `loading.tsx`.
    - Interactions on data the page already has (tabs, sorting, search) update in the browser and keep the URL in sync with `window.history`, without a server round trip.
    - Don't add server actions or Route Handlers for app data. The only exception is something that needs a server-side secret, such as sending an email.

    ### Optimization and Best Practices
    - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
    - Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
    - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

    ### Error Handling and Validation
    - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
      - Use early returns for error conditions.
      - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
      - Use custom error types for consistent error handling.

    ### UI and Styling
    - Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
    - Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.

    ### State Management and Data Fetching
    - Use TanStack React Query (already provided by `Web3Provider`) for backend data, and wagmi hooks for on-chain reads. After a transaction, invalidate the affected queries instead of refreshing the page.
    - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

    ### Security and Performance
    - Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
    - Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

    ### Testing and Documentation
    - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
    - Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
    - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

    ### Methodology
    1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
    2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
    3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

    **Process**:
    1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
    2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
    3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
    4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
    5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
